     Script is heavily modified version of asuseroakos script found from here: http:tinyurl.com/arma3glovepiebasic<br />
     Most important change is in the if condition structure that allows much smaller file size.<br />
     Original script has almost the same functionality and is bigger by almost 3000 rows.<br />
