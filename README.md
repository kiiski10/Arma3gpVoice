#Arma3 voice commands#

Script is heavily modified version of asuseroakos script found from here: [http:tinyurl.com/arma3glovepiebasic](http:tinyurl.com/arma3glovepiebasic)<br />
Most important change is in the if condition structure that allows much smaller file size.
Original script has almost the same functionality and is bigger by almost 3000 rows.
